Have you got colour in your cheeks?
<br>    
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
<br>    
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
<br>    
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
<br>    
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
<br>    
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
<br>    
How many secrets can you keep?
<br>    
'Cause there's this tune I found
<br>    
That makes me think of you somehow
<br>    
And I play it on repeat
<br>    
Until I fall asleep
<br>    
Spilling drinks on my settee </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
(Do I wanna know)
<br>    
If this feeling flows both ways?
<br>    
(Sad to see you go)
<br>    
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
<br>    
(Baby, we both know)
<br>    
That the nights were mainly made
<br>    
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
Crawling back to you
<br>    
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
<br>    
'Cause I always do
<br>    
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
<br>    
Now, I've thought it through
<br>    
Crawling back to you </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
So have you got the guts?
<br>    
Been wondering if your heart's still open
<br>    
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
<br>    
Simmer down and pucker up
<br>    
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
<br>    
Of trying to kiss you
<br>    
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
<br>    
But we could be together if you wanted to </font> </p>
<br>

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (You've had a few?)
<br>    
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
<br>    
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)
<br>    
Busy being yours (being yours)
<br>    
To fall for somebody new
<br>    
Now, I've thought it through
<br>

Ever thought of calling, darling?

(Do I wanna know?)

Do you want me crawling back to you? </font> </p>
