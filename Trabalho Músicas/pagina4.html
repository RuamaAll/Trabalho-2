Well oh they might wear classic reeboks
<br>    
Or knackered converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
<br>    
But all of that's what the point is not
<br>   
The point's that there ain't no romance around there </font> </p> 
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
And there's the truth that they can't see
<br>    
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
<br>    
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
<br>    
Agree that there ain't no romance around there </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
<br>    
We'll tell 'em if you like
<br>    
We'll tell 'em all tonight
<br>    
They'll never listen
<br>    
Because their minds are made up
<br>    
And course it's all okay to carry on that way </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
Is over there there's broken bones
<br>    
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
<br>    
And it don't take no sherlock holmes
<br>    
To see it's a little different around here </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
<br>    
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
<br>    
And just cause he's had a coupla cans
<br>    
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
Don't you know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
<br>    
We'll tell em if you like
<br>    
We'll tell em all tonight
<br>    
They'll never listen
<br>    
Because their minds are made up
<br>    
And course it's all okay to carry on that way </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
I said no
<br>    
Oh, no!
<br>    
Well, oh, you won't get me to go!
<br>    
Not anywhere, not anywhere
<br>    
No, I won't go
<br>    
Oh, no, no! </font> </p>
<br>    
    
<p> <font size="4"face="Arial" color="white">
Well over there there's friends of mine
<br>    
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
<br>    
And they might overstep the line
<br>    
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
<br>    
No not in the same way
<br>    
So not in the same way
<br>    
Oh, no, oh, no, no </font> </p>
